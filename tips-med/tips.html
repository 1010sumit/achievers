                    <p>
                        We’ve gone over the basic breath meditation so far, but there are other mindfulness techniques
                        that use different focal points than the breath to anchor our attention—external objects like a
                        sound in the room, or something broader, such as noticing spontaneous things that come into your
                        awareness during an aimless wandering practice. But all of these practices have one thing in
                        common: We notice that our minds ARE running the show a lot of the time. It’s true. We think
                        thoughts, typically, and then we act. But here are some helpful strategies to change that up:

                <h2>How to Make Mindfulness a Habit</h2>
                <img src="../images-med/get-comfortable.png" alt="">
                <p>It’s estimated that 95% of our behavior runs on autopilot. That’s because neural networks underlie
                    all of
                    our habits, reducing our millions of sensory inputs per second into manageable shortcuts so we can
                    function in this crazy world. These default brain signals are so efficient that they often cause us
                    to
                    relapse into old behaviors before we remember what we meant to do instead.
                    <br>
                    Mindfulness is the exact opposite of these default processes. It’s executive control rather than
                    autopilot, and enables intentional actions, willpower, and decisions. But that takes practice. The
                    more
                    we activate the intentional brain, the stronger it gets. Every time we do something deliberate and
                    new,
                    we stimulate neuroplasticity, activating our grey matter, which is full of newly sprouted neurons
                    that
                    have not yet been groomed for “autopilot” brain.
                    <br>
                    But here’s the problem. While our intentional brain knows what is best for us, our autopilot brain
                    causes us to shortcut our way through life. So how can we trigger ourselves to be mindful when we
                    need
                    it most? This is where the notion of “behavior design” comes in. It’s a way to put your intentional
                    brain in the driver’s seat. There are two ways to do that—first, slowing down the autopilot brain by
                    putting obstacles in its way, and second, removing obstacles in the path of the intentional brain,
                    so it
                    can gain control.
                    <br>
                    Shifting the balance to give your intentional brain more power takes some work, though. Here are
                    some
                    ways to get started.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>
                            Put meditation reminders around you
                        </h4>If you intend to do some yoga or to meditate, put your yoga mat or your meditation cushion
                        in
                        the middle of your floor so you can’t miss it as you walk by.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>
                            Refresh your reminders regularly.
                        </h4>Say you decide to use sticky notes to remind yourself of a new intention. That might work
                        for
                        about a week, but then your autopilot brain and old habits take over again. Try writing new
                        notes to
                        yourself; add variety or make them funny. That way they’ll stick with you longer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>
                            Create new patterns.
                        </h4>You could try a series of “If this, then that” messages to create easy reminders to shift
                        into
                        the intentional brain. For instance, you might come up with, “If office door, then deep breath,”
                        as
                        a way to shift into mindfulness as you are about to start your workday. Or, “If phone rings,
                        take a
                        breath before answering.” Each intentional action to shift into mindfulness will strengthen your
                        intentional brain.

            <h2>How Much Should I Meditate?</h2>
            <img class="images" src="../images-med/follow your breath.png" alt="">
            <p>Meditation is no more complicated than what we’ve described above. It is that simple … and that
                challenging. It’s also powerful and worth it. The key is to commit to sit every day, even if it’s
                for
                five minutes. Meditation teacher Sharon Salzberg says: “One of my meditation teachers said that the
                most
                important moment in your meditation practice is the moment you sit down to do it. Because right then
                you’re saying to yourself that you believe in change, you believe in caring for yourself, and you’re
                making it real. You’re not just holding some value like mindfulness or compassion in the abstract,
                but
                really making it real.”
                <br>
                Recent research from neuroscientist Amishi Jha discovered that 12 minutes of meditation, 5 days a
                week
                can protect and strengthen your ability to pay attention.

                            begun. Everyone
                            wonders that. Notice it. Escort your attention back to your object of focus (the
                            breath).
                            When you’re lost and questioning again, come back to the breathe again. That’s the

                            to
                            interrupt your session to relate to them. If that’s what’s going to happen, try to find
