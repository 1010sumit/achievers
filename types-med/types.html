                    <p>
                        Once you have explored a basic seated meditation practice, you might want to consider other
                        forms of meditation including walking and lying down. Whereas the previous meditations used the
                        breath as a focal point for practice, these meditations below focus on different parts of the
                        body.

            <h2>Introduction to the Body Scan Meditation</h2>
            <img src="../images-med/body scan meditation.png" alt="">
            <div class="stytle1">

                <p>
                    Try this: feel your feet on the ground right now. In your shoes or without, it doesn’t matter. Then
                    track or scan over your whole body, bit by bit—slowly—all the way up to the crown of your head. The
                    point of this practice is to check in with your whole body: Fingertips to shoulders, butt to big
                    toe. Only rules are: No judging, no wondering, no worrying (all activities your mind may want to
                    do); just check in with the physical feeling of being in your body. Aches and pains are fine. You
                    don’t have to do anything about anything here. You’re just noticing.
                    <br>
                    Begin to focus your attention on different parts of your body. You can spotlight one particular area
                    or go through a sequence like this: toes, feet (sole, heel, top of foot), through the legs, pelvis,
                    abdomen, lower back, upper back, chest shoulders, arms down to the fingers, shoulders, neck,
                    different parts of the face, and head. For each part of the body, linger for a few moments and
                    notice the different sensations as you focus.
                    <br>
                    The moment you notice that your mind has wandered, return your attention to the part of the body you
                    last remember.
                    <br>
                    If you fall asleep during this body-scan practice, that’s okay. When you realize you’ve been nodding
                    off, take a deep breath to help you reawaken and perhaps reposition your body (which will also help
                    wake it up). When you’re ready, return your attention to the part of the body you last remember
                    focusing on.

            <h2> Introduction to the Walking Meditation</h2>
            <img src="../images-med/walking meditation.png" alt="">
            <div class="style2">


                <p> Most of us live pretty sedentary lives, leaving us to build extra-curricular physical activity into
                    our days to counteract all that. Point is: Mindfulness doesn’t have to feel like another thing on
                    your to-do list. It can be injected into some of the activities you’re already doing. Here’s how to
                    integrate a mindful walking practice into your day.
                    <br>
                    As you begin, walk at a natural pace. Place your hands wherever comfortable: on your belly, behind
                    your back, or at your sides.
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you find it useful, <strong>
                            you can count steps up to 10,</strong> and then start back at one again. If you’re in a
                        small space, as you reach ten, pause, and with intention, choose a moment to turn around.</li>
                    <li>Whatever else captures your attention, <strong> come back to the sensation of walking.</strong>
                        Your mind will wander, so without frustration, guide it back again as many times as you need.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Particularly outdoors, <strong> maintain a larger sense of the environment around you,</strong>
                        taking it all in, staying safe and aware
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Introduction to Loving-Kindness Meditation</h3>
            <img src="../images-med/loving kindness meditation.png" alt="">
            <div class="style3">
                <p>You cannot will yourself into particular feelings toward yourself or anyone else. Rather, you can
                    practice reminding yourself that you deserve happiness and ease and that the same goes for your
                    child, your family, your friends, your neighbors, and everyone else in the world.
                    <br>
                    This loving-kindness practice involves silently repeating phrases that offer good qualities to
                    oneself and to others.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>
                            You can start by taking delight in your own goodness—
                        </h4>calling to mind things you have done out of good-heartedness, and rejoicing in those
                        memories to celebrate the potential for goodness we all share.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>
                            Silently recite phrases
                        </h4> that reflect what we wish most deeply for ourselves in an enduring way. Traditional
                        phrases: <br>
                        • May I live in safety. <br>
                        • May I have mental happiness (peace, joy). <br>
                        • May I have physical happiness (health, freedom from pain). <br>
                        • May I live with ease.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>
                            Repeat the phrases
                        </h4>with enough space and silence between so they fall into a rhythm that is pleasing to you.
                        Direct your attention to one phrase at a time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>
                            Each time you notice your attention has wandered, be kind to yourself
                        </h4>and let go of the distraction. Come back to repeating the phrases without judging or
                        disparaging yourself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>
                            After some time, visualize yourself in the center of a circle
                        </h4>composed of those who have been kind to you, or have inspired you because of their love.
                        Perhaps you’ve met them, or read about them; perhaps they live now, or have existed historically
                        or even mythically. That is the circle. As you visualize yourself in the center of it,
                        experience yourself as the recipient of their love and attention. Keep gently repeating the
                        phrases of loving-kindness for yourself
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>
                            To close the session, let go of the visualization,
                        </h4>and simply keep repeating the phrases for a few more minutes. Each time you do so, you are
                        transforming your old, hurtful relationship to yourself, and are moving forward, sustained by
                        the force of kindness.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                        <p class="hello">When you find yourself asking that question, your meditation has officially begun. Everyone
                            wonders that. Notice it. Escort your attention back to your object of focus (the breath).
                            When you’re lost and questioning again, come back to the breathe again. That’s the practice.
                            There’s no limit to the number of times you can be distracted and come back to the breath.
                            Meditating is not a race to perfection—It’s returning again and again to the breath.</p>

                            settles down on a part of your cushion, no big deal. Let it be. What works less well is to
                            interrupt your session to relate to them. If that’s what’s going to happen, try to find a
                            way to avoid their interrupting your practice.</p>
