        <h1>CIRCLE</h1>
        <p>
            As we know that a circle is a closed two-dimensional geometrical figure, such that all points on the surface of a circle are equidistant from the point called the “centre”. The distance from the centre to any point on the surface of a circle is called “Radius”.  </p>

        <h3>Circle and line in a plane</h3>
        <p>For a circle and a line on a plane, there can be three possibilities</p>
        <ul>
            <li> i) they can be non-intersecting</li>
            <li> ii) they can have a single common point: in this case, the line touches the circle.</li>
            <li>iii) they can have two common points: in this case, the line cuts the circle.</li>
        
        </ul>

       <h3>Tangent</h3>
       <p>A tangent to a circle is a line that touches the circle at exactly one point. For every point on the circle, there is a unique tangent passing through it.</p>

       <h3>Secant</h3>
       <p>A secant to a circle is a line that has two points in common with the circle. It cuts the circle at two points, forming a chord of the circle.</p>
       <img src="./images/secent.png" alt="">
       <h3>Tangent as a special case of Secant</h3>
       <p>The tangent to a circle can be seen as a special case of the secant when the two endpoints of its corresponding chord coincide.</p>
       <img src="./images/special secant.png" alt="">
       <h3>Two parallel tangents at most for a given secant</h3>
       <p> For every given secant of a circle, there are exactly two tangents which are parallel to it and touches the circle at two diametrically opposite points.</p>
       <img src="./images/parallel tangent.png" alt="">
       <p>From the given diagram, we can observe the following points:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>PQ is the secant of a circle.</li>
        <li>P’Q’ & P”Q” are two tangents which are parallel to PQ.</li>
       </ul>
