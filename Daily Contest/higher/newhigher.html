        <h1>Gravity</h1>
        <p>
           Gravity is a force that attracts a body towards the centre of the earth, or towards any other physical body having mass. </p>

        <h3>History of Gravity</h3>
        
        <p>
            In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton first discovered gravity. While sitting under an apple tree, he noticed an apple falling down. Then he tried to figure out why the apple instead of going up or left or right, came down. In this situation, there was clearly an unknown force at play, that force is what Newton called gravity and his theory is called Newton’s law of Universal Gravitation.
            <br>
            Later in the early 20th century, Albert Einstein developed a whole new idea about gravity. According to him, gravity is the warping of space and time. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Gravity in Universe</h3>
        <p>After understanding what is gravity, let us know how gravity plays a major role in sustaining life on earth. It is because of the gravitational pull between the earth and the sun the atmosphere is kept in place and provides us with the air that we need to breathe in order to survive. It also keeps us at a safe distance from the sun allowing us to enjoy the sun’s light and warmth.</p>

        <h3>Relationship Between Gravity and Weight</h3>
        <img src="./images/g2.png" alt="">
        <p>Weight is defined as the force with which a body is attracted to the earth by gravitation. It is just another word for the force of gravity Fg. Weight is a force that acts on all objects near earth. The weight of an object can be calculated by multiplying the mass of the body with the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.8 m/s2).
<br>

            Mathematically, it is represented as:
            <br>
            Fg = mg</p>
