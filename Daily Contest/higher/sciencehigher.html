        <h1>Metals and Non-metals</h1>
        <p> Physical properties of metals, chemical properties of metals and non-metal oxide. 
           <br> Metals are the elements that conduct heat and electricity and are malleable and ductile. Examples are Iron (Fe), Aluminium (Al), Silver (Ag), Copper (Cu), Gold (Au), Platinum (Pt), Lead (Pb), Potassium (K), Sodium (Na), Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg) etc.
           <br>Metals are the elements which form positive ions by losing electrons. Thus, metals are known as Electropositive Elements.
            </p>

        <h3>Physical Properties of Metals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1. HARDNESS : Most of the metals are hard, except alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, lithium, etc. are very soft metals. These can be cut by using a knife.</li>
            <li>2. STRENGTH : Most of the metals are strong and have high tensile strength. Because of this, big structures are made using metals, such as copper (Cu) and iron (Fe). (Except Sodium (Na) and potassium (K) which are soft metals).</li>
            <li>3. STATES Metals are solid at room temperature except for mercury (Hg).</li>
            <li>4. DUCTILITY : Metals are ductile. This means metals can be drawn into thin wire. Because of this property, a wire is made of metals.</li>
            <li>5. Melting and Boiling Point: Metals have generally high melting and boiling points. (Except sodium and potassium metals which have low melting and boiling point.)</li>
            <li> 6. Density: Most of the metals have a high density. <br>
               7. Colour: Most of the metals are grey in colour. But gold and copper are exceptions.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        


      

        <h3>Physical Properties of Non-Metals</h3>
        <p> Physical Properties of non-metals, chemical properties of non-metals, non¬metal oxides, Reaction of metal and Non-metal, Ionic bonds and formation of an ionic bond. Non-metals are the elements that do not conduct electricity and are neither malleable nor ductile.
Examples: Carbon (C), Sulphur (S), Phosphorous (P), Silicon (Si), Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), Chlorine (Cl), Bromine (Br), Neon (Ne) and Argon (Ar) etc.
<br>
Non-metals are the elements which form negative ions by gaining an electron. Thus, non¬metals are also known as Electronegative Elements.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> 1. HARDNESS :Non-metals are not hard rather they are generally soft. But the diamond is an exception; it is the hardest naturally occurring substance </li>
            <li>2. LUSTRE : Non-metals have a dull appearance. Diamond and iodine are exceptions.</li>
            <li>3. STATES : Non-metals may be solid, liquid or gas.</li>
            <li>4. SONORITY : Non-metals are not sonorous, i.e., they do not produce a typical sound on being hit.</li>
            <li>5. CONDUCTION: Non-metals are a bad conductor of heat and electricity. Graphite which is allotrope of carbon is a good conductor of electricity and is an exception.</li>
            <li> 6. Density:  Most of the non-metals have low density<br>
               7. Colour: Non-metals are in many colours.</li>
        </ul>
