        <h1>PRECENTAGE</h1>
        <p>
            In mathematics, a percentage is a number or ratio that can be expressed as a fraction of 100. If we have to
            calculate percent of a number, divide the number by the whole and multiply by 100. Hence, the percentage
            means, a part per hundred. The word per cent means per 100. It is represented by the symbol “%”. </p>

        <h3>Examples of percentages are:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 10% is equal to 1/10 fraction</li>
            <li> 20% is equivalent to ⅕ fraction</li>
            <li> 25% is equivalent to ¼ fraction</li>
            <li>50% is equivalent to ½ fraction</li>
            <li>75% is equivalent to ¾ fraction</li>
            <li> 90% is equivalent to 9/10 fraction</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            Percentages have no dimension. Hence it is called a dimensionless number. If we say, 50% of a number, then
            it
            means 50 per cent of its whole.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Percentages can also be represented in decimal or fraction form, such as 0.6%, 0.25%, etc. In academics, the
            marks obtained in any subject are calculated in terms of percentage. Like, Ram has got 78% of marks in his
            final
            exam. So, this percentage is calculated on account of the total marks obtained by Ram, in all subjects to
            the
            total marks.</p>

        <h3>Percentage Formula</h3>
        We should know the percentage formulas to calculate the percentages. The basic formula used to calculate the
        percentage is equal to the ratio of actual value to the total value and multiply it by 100. The formula of the
        percentages expressed asPercentage % = (Actual value∗100)/Total value.

        <h3>How to Calculate the Percentage of a Number</h3>
        <p> Step-by-Step Percentage Change Calculation:
            <br>
            Calculate the difference (increase) between the two figures you're comparing to arrive at a percentage
            increase:
            <br>
            Increase = Original Number - New Number
            <br>
            Then multiply the result by 100 by dividing the increase by the original number:
            <br>
            Increase by 100 per cent of the original number.
            <br>
            If the response is a negative figure, the percentage change will be negative.
            <br>
            Calculate the difference (reduction) between the two numbers you're comparing.
            <br>
            Original Number - New Number = Decrease
            <br>
            Then multiply the result by 100 by dividing the decrease by the original number.
            <br>
            Decrease Original Number by 100 per cent = Decrease Original Number by 100 per cent
            <br>
            This is a percentage increase if the answer is a negative number
            <br>
            If you want to compute the % rise or reduction of numerous integers, you should use the percentage increase
            formula. When the percentage rises, it is indicated by a positive value, but when the percentage reduces, is
            shown by a negative figure. <br>We need to use some formula to calculate the percentage of a number. The
            formula which is to be used is: <br>P% of a number = X <br>Where x is the required percentage <br>If the
            percentage sign is removed, then the above formula is expressed
        </p>
