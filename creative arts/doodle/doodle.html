        <h1>DOODLE ART</h1>
        
        <p>While doodling has been defined as “drawing or scribbling aimlessly,” I couldn’t disagree more. If you can
            believe it, doodling has the capacity to improve memory, focus, and cognition.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For those of you who say doodling isn’t art, you are missing the point. It is a form of expression that, says
            Heller, “often triggers insights and discoveries that aren’t possible through words alone. Just think of all
            those napkins (or Post-Its) on which million-dollar ideas were sketched out.” As art teachers we should be
            teaching our students not just to make art, but how to think artistically and develop ideas and
            understandings in all kinds of capacities</p>

        <h3>Doodle art instructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Draw a continuous big loopy line with multiple curves. Have the line cross to make different size
                shapes.
                <br>
                <p>The more shapes your line or doodle makes, the more colorful your picture will be.</p>
                
                <p>There is no right or wrong way. Just let your kids creative process scribble a doodle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>2. Color in the “shapes” your line created. If you want, you can leave some of the shapes white. <p> You
                can color your art in a pattern or you can randomly pick your colors. We randomly picked our colors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>3. Enjoy your artwork. <br></li>
        </ul>
